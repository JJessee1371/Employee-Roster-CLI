# Employee-Roster-CLI

## Description
This CLI application builds an employee roster based on the input that is gathered from the user via
the inquirer module. Each new addition is created through the use of classes and that information is 
also used to fill HTML templates that are eventually compressed into a single output file.

## Credits
The overall file structure, HTML templates, testing, and HTML render function were all provided by the University of Utah coding bootcamp.
