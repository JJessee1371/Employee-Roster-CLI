# Employee-Roster-CLI

## Description
This CLI application builds an employee roster based on the input that is gathered from the user via
the inquirer module. Each new addition is created utilizing classes and then is converted into an HTML
format that the user can view. The purpose behind this project was to develope a familiarity with the
principles of Object Oritented Programming in a manner that could apply directly to a real world situation.
